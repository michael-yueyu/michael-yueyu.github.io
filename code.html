    <p> Modelling pedestrian movement uncertainty in complex urban environments is regarded as a meaningful and challenging task regarding the promotion of geospatial data mining and analysis. However, the traditional uncertainty prediction model only takes the movement distance or speed into consideration and is not able to adapt well to time-varying measurement errors. In this paper, a deep-learning framework is proposed for modelling pedestrian movement uncertainty in large-scale indoor areas, in which a hybrid deep-learning model combines a one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) with a long short-term memory (LSTM) network is proposed for enhancing feature extraction performance and reducing time correlation errors. The proposed framework takes human motion related measurement features into consideration, in which the moving step-length and heading information during a time period are also reconstructed and modelled as the input to the deep-learning model. Compared with state-of-art algorithms applied to different real-world trajectory datasets, the proposed deep-learning approach demonstrates much better performance of uncertainty region prediction, including the different indexes (Euclidean error distance, completeness and density) This study has leaded to the provision of an effective and practical framework for modelling trajectory uncertainty of the pedestrian in challenging urban environments, and which is expected to benefit smart city and spatial perception related applications. </p>

    <p> Indoor location-based services have become more and more important due to their potential applications in a wide range of personalized services in recent years. The accuracy of smartphone based 3D indoor localization is subjected to the poor performance of low-cost sensors and limited coverage of location sources. In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes a precise 3D indoor localization and trajectory optimization framework that uses the combination of sparse Wi-Fi Fine Time Measurement (FTM) anchors and built-in sensors (3D-LOWS). The inertial navigation system (INS) mechanization, multi-level constraints and observed values are integrated by the adaptive unscented Kalman filter to eliminate effects of cumulative error, indoor magnetic interference, and diversity of handheld modes. The Wi-Fi based ranging and landmark detection information is used to provide an accurate absolute reference to the built-in sensors based method. In addition, this paper proposes and evaluates two different trajectory optimization algorithms and compares the improved localization performance. The comprehensive experiments indicate that the proposed 3D-LOWS is proved to achieve accurate and stable 3D indoor positioning and trajectory optimization performance under complex indoor environments using sparse wireless stations. </p>

    <p> Indoor wireless localization using Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacons has attracted considerable attention due to its extensive distribution and low cost properties. This article proposes a novel 3-D indoor localization algorithm which uses the combination of BLE and multiple sensors (3D-LBMS). The inertial navigation system (INS) and pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) mechanizations are combined for accurate heading and speed estimation, which contains a multilevel constraints-based quasistatic magnetic field (QSMF) detection algorithm. In addition, dynamic-time-warping (DTW)-based BLE landmark detection algorithm is proposed to provide absolute 3-D location reference to multiple sensors-based positioning method, and the detected BLE landmark points are also used to calibrate the parameter of step-length calculation. Finally, the adaptive unscented Kalman filter (AUKF) is applied to fuse the results of INS/PDR mechanizations, QSMF and locations of detected BLE landmarks to achieve accurate and concrete multisource-based 3-D indoor localization performance. The experimental results show that the proposed 3-D-LBMS is proved to achieve meterlevel 2-D positioning accuracy and submeter level 3-D altitude estimation accuracy in typical indoor environments. </p>

    <p> Indoor wireless localization toward the next generation Wi-Fi access point has attracted considerable attention due to the presentation of the state-of-art Wi-Fi fine time measurement (FTM) protocol. In order to improve the autonomy, accuracy, and universality of wireless positioning based on the Internet of Things (IoT) terminals, this article proposes a hybrid wireless positioning system which contains the integration of Wi-Fi FTM, crowdsourced received signal strength indicator (RSSI) fingerprinting and micro-electro-mechanical-system (MEMS) sensors (H-WPS). A light-weight pedestrian aimed inertial navigation system (PINS) is proposed, which contains multilevel constraints and a global optimization model in order to eliminate the cumulative error caused by INS update. A deep-learning-based Wi-Fi fingerprinting database generation framework is developed for crowdsourced trajectories evaluation and selection. In addition, three different multisource integration models are applied to fuse the information of PINS, Wi-Fi FTM and RSSI fingerprinting, and calibrate the Wi-Fi ranging bias in real time, which is further enhanced by a novel misclosure check and the multilayer perceptron contained signal quality evaluation strategy. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed H-WPS achieves much more precise and universal indoor positioning performance compared with the single location source, and meter-level localization precision can be realized in the Wi-Fi FTM-covered indoor scenes. </p>

    <p> Location-based services have become more and more important with the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology in recent years. Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is widely used for positioning outdoors while it is still challenging to realize accurate and universal 3D indoor localization in complex indoor environments. Crowdsourcing-based positioning method is proposed aiming at autonomously constructing the navigation database based on the pedestrians’ daily-life data. This paper proposes an autonomous 3D indoor localization algorithm using the combination of crowdsourced Wi-Fi fingerprinting and Micro-Electro-Mechanical System sensors (3D-CSWS). An enhanced complementary filter is applied to provide accurate attitude information by integrating multi-sensor data with the detection of external acceleration and quasi-static magnetic field. In addition, the gradient descent (GD) algorithm is proposed to optimize the forward pedestrian dead reckoning and the optimized trajectories are weighted fused to construct the final navigation database after quality evaluation. In the on-line phase, the adaptive particle filter is used to integrate the results of Wi-Fi fingerprinting and multiple sensors to provide accurate and concrete 3D indoor localization performance. The real-world experimental results demonstrate that the proposed 3D-CSWS is proved to achieve autonomous and precise 3D indoor localization performance among complex indoor environments. </p>

    <p> Seamless localization service is regarded as an essential requirement towards smart city based applications. The performance of seamless localization is restricted by the limited coverage of indoor navigation database and disturbed results of the location sources in complex urban environments. This paper proposes a map-assisted seamless localization framework that uses the self-constructed navigation database and Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) based signal quality control criteria (SL-SDBQ). Daily-life trajectories provided by the inertial odometry are optimized and calibrated by the map-originated indoor pedestrian network information for self-constructing the crowdsourced navigation database, and the Bi-LSTM is applied for quality evaluation of different location sources. In addition, the robust Kalman filter is adopted to integrate the information of inertial odometry, crowdsourced Wi-Fi fingerprinting, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), and signal quality evaluation results, and the error ellipse is applied for map matching to further enhance the performance of multi-source fusion based seamless positioning. The experimental results prove that the proposed SL-SDBQ can achieve autonomous and precise indoor and outdoor positioning performance, and meter-level localization precision can be realized under the assistance of indoor map. </p>

    <p> Foot-mounted positioning system (FPS) is regarded as an important application for GPS-denied scenes, including but not limited to emergency rescue, medical health, and individual soldier positioning. With the assistance of zero-velocity update technology (ZUPT), the basic positioning function can be realized, while the largest problem is that the accumulation of systematic heading drift and positioning error cannot be completely constrained. This article presents a robust FPS based on dual inertial measurement unit data and ultrasonic ranging (FPS-DU). Bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) network is developed for the recognition of quasi-static (QS) period for the performance enhancement of ZUPT, and multilevel constraints are modeled for decreasing the cumulative error of the single foot-mounted model. In addition, a unified Kalman-based location estimator is developed combining dual foot-mounted inertial data and sphere constraint-based ultrasonic ranging results, enhanced by a robust ultrasonic outlier detector. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed FPS-DU realizes much more accurate and robust positioning accuracy (between 0.371% and 0.548% under different test environments and traveled distances) compared with traditional single FPSs (S-FPSs). </p>

    <p> More and more applications of location-based services lead to the development of indoor positioning technology. Wi-Fi-based indoor localization has been attractive due to its extensive distribution and low cost properties. IEEE 802.11-2016 now includes a Wi-Fi Fine Time Measurement (FTM) protocol which provides a more robust approach for Wi-Fi ranging between the mobile terminal and Wi-Fi access point (AP). To improve the positioning accuracy, in this paper, we propose a robust dead reckoning algorithm combining the results of Wi-Fi FTM and multiple sensors (DRWMs). A real-time Wi-Fi ranging model is built which can effectively reduce the Wi-Fi ranging errors, and then a multisensor multi-pattern-based dead reckoning is presented. In addition, the Unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is applied to fuse the results of Wi-Fi ranging model and multiple sensors. The experiment results show that the proposed DRWMs algorithm can achieve accurate localization performance in line-of-sight/non-line-of-sight (LOS)/(NLOS) mixed indoor environment. Compared with the traditional Wi-Fi positioning method and the traditional dead reckoning method, the proposed algorithm is more stable and has better real-time performance for indoor positioning. </p>

    <p> Crowd-sensing-based localization is regarded as an effective method for providing indoor location-based services in large-scale urban areas. The performance of the crowd-sensing approach is subject to the poor accuracy of collected daily-life trajectories and the efficient combination of different location sources and indoor maps. This paper proposes a robust map-assisted 3D Indoor localization framework using crowd-sensing-based trajectory data and error ellipse-enhanced fusion (ML-CTEF). In the off-line phase, novel inertial odometry which contains the combination of 1D-convolutional neural networks (1D-CNN) and Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM)-based walking speed estimator is proposed for accurate crowd-sensing trajectories data pre-processing under different handheld modes. The Bi-LSTM network is further applied for floor identification, and the indoor network matching algorithm is adopted for the generation of fingerprinting database without pain. In the online phase, an error ellipse-assisted particle filter is proposed for the intelligent integration of inertial odometry, crowdsourced Wi-Fi fingerprinting, and indoor map information. The experimental results prove that the proposed ML-CTEF realizes autonomous and precise 3D indoor localization performance under complex and large-scale indoor environments; the estimated average positioning error is within 1.01 m in a multi-floor contained indoor building. </p>

    <p> Crowdsourced localization using geo-spatial big data has become an effective approach for constructing smart-city-based location services with the fast growing number of Internet of Things terminals. This paper presents a self-calibrated multi-floor indoor positioning framework using a combination of Wi-Fi ranging, crowdsourced fingerprinting and low-cost sensors (SM-WRFS). The localization parameters, such as heading and altitude biases, step-length scale factor, and Wi-Fi ranging bias are autonomously calibrated to provide a more accurate forward 3D localization performance. In addition, the backward smoothing algorithm and a novel deep-learning model are applied in order to construct an autonomous and efficient crowdsourced Wi-Fi fingerprinting database using the detected quick response (QR) code-based landmarks. Finally, the adaptive extended Kalman filter is adopted to combine the corresponding location sources using different integration models to provide a precise multi-source fusion based multi-floor indoor localization performance. The real-world experiments demonstrate that the presented SM-WRFS is proven to realize precise 3D indoor positioning under different environments, and the meter-level positioning accuracy can be acquired in Wi-Fi ranging supported indoor areas. </p>

    <p> Due to the complexity of urban environments, localizing pedestrians indoors using mobile terminals is an urgent task in many emerging areas. Multi-source fusion-based localization is considered to be an effective way to provide location-based services in large-scale indoor areas. This paper presents an intelligent 3D indoor localization framework that uses the integration of Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), quick response (QR) code, and micro-electro-mechanical system sensors (the 3D-WBQM framework). An enhanced inertial odometry was developed for accurate pedestrian localization and trajectory optimization in indoor spaces containing magnetic interference and external acceleration, and Wi-Fi fine time Measurement stations, BLE nodes, and QR codes were applied for landmark detection to provide an absolute reference for trajectory optimization and crowdsourced navigation database construction. In addition, the robust unscented Kalman filter (RUKF) was applied as a generic integrated model to combine the estimated location results from inertial odometry, BLE, QR, Wi-Fi FTM, and the crowdsourced Wi-Fi fingerprinting for large-scale indoor positioning. The experimental results indicated that the proposed 3D-WBQM framework was verified to realize autonomous and accurate positioning performance in large-scale indoor areas using different location sources, and meter-level positioning accuracy can be acquired in Wi-Fi FTM supported areas. </p>

    <p> Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) has been widely applied for outdoor localization while it is still challenging to realize seamless positioning due to the limited coverage of accurate indoor location sources. This letter proposes a robust seamless localization framework using the combination of GNSS, Wi-Fi Fine Time Measurement and built-in sensors (SL-GWBS). Pedestrian dead reckoning and magnetic detection are used to decrease the cumulative error of inertial navigation system for accurate heading and speed estimation, and an adaptive multi-model based extended Kalman filter is adopted to realize concrete localization towards different integration methods of location sources. The experimental results demonstrate the meter-level accuracy of the proposed SL-GWBS.</p>

    <p> Acquiring precise and reliable 3D pedestrian trajectories is gradually developed into an essential task for achieving indoor location-based services. A foot-mounted positioning system (FPS) is proved to be an effective approach for multi-floor indoor navigation, while the performance of FPS is usually reduced by the cumulative sensor error, disturbed local magnetic field, and external accelerations. This paper proposes a precise 3D foot-mounted indoor localization system based on the commercial sensors and map matching approach (3D-FSMM). The 1D convolutional neural network model is applied to the detection of quasi-static period to enhance accuracy of the zero velocity update technology algorithm, and the multi-level observations are extracted to constrain the positioning error originated from the low-cost inertial sensors and complex local environments. In addition, the indoor map information is further extracted for corner detection and optimization of estimated trajectory, and the error ellipse is established for indoor map matching in order to provide more absolute reference. The experimental results indicate that the proposed 3D-FSMM realizes meter-level positioning accuracy in disturbed and multi-floor contained indoor scenes, and has the potential for large-scaled indoor applications. </p>

    <p> Indoor positioning systems have received increasing attention for supporting location-based services in indoor environments. Wi-Fi based indoor localisation has become attractive due to its extensive distribution and low cost properties. IEEE 802.11-2016 now includes a Wi-Fi Fine Time Measurement (FTM) protocol which can be used for Wi-Fi ranging between intelligent terminal and Wi-Fi access point. This paper introduces a framework of Wi-Fi FTM data acquisition and processing that can be used for indoor localisation. We analyse the main factors that affect the accuracy of Wi-Fi ranging and propose a calibration, filtering and modelling algorithm that can effectively reduce the ranging error caused by clock deviation, non-line-of-sight (NLOS) and multipath propagation. Experimental results show that the proposed calibration and filtering method is able to achieve metre-level ranging accuracy in case of line-of-sight by using large bandwidth. Estimation results also show that the proposed Wi-Fi ranging model provides an accurate ranging performance in NLOS and multipath contained indoor environment; the final positioning error is less than 2·2 m with a stable output frequency of 3 Hz. </p>

    <p> Understanding the space–time pattern of the transmission locations of COVID-19, as well as the relationship between the pattern, socioeconomic status, and environmental factors, is important for pandemic prevention. Most existing research mainly analyzes the locations resided in or visited by COVID-19 cases, while few studies have been undertaken on the space–time pattern of the locations at which the transmissions took place and its associated influencing factors. To fill this gap, this study focuses on the space–time distribution patterns of COVID-19 transmission locations and the association between such patterns and urban factors. With Hong Kong as the study area, transmission chains of the four waves of COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong during the time period of January 2020 to June 2021 were reconstructed from the collected case information, and then the locations of COVID-19 transmission were inferred from the transmission chains. Statistically significant clusters of COVID-19 transmission locations at the level of tertiary planning units (TPUs) were detected and compared among different waves of COVID-19 outbreak. The high-risk areas and the associated influencing factors of different waves were also investigated. The results indicate that COVID-19 transmission began with the Hong Kong Island, further moved northward towards the New Territories, and finally shifted to the south Hong Kong Island, and the transmission population shows a difference between residential locations and non-residential locations. The research results can provide health authorities and policy-makers with useful information for pandemic prevention, as well as serve as a guide to the public in the avoidance of activities and places with a high risk of contagion. </p>
